- **One Account Per Email**: Each email address can only be associated with one user account.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invitation Not Found" Error
- The invitation may have expired (after 7 days)
- The invitation might have been deleted by an administrator
- The invitation token in the URL might be incorrect or incomplete

### "Invitation Already Accepted" Error
- Someone has already used this invitation to create an account
- You may have already accepted the invitation in another browser session

### "Failed to Create Account" Error
- The username you chose might already be taken
- The password might not meet the minimum requirements
- There might be a temporary system issue

If you encounter persistent issues, contact the person who invited you or the system administrator for assistance.
