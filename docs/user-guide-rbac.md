# PropSku: User Guide - Role-Based Access Control

## Understanding User Roles

PropSku offers three distinct user roles, each designed to provide appropriate access based on your responsibilities:

### Standard User

**Best for**: Property staff, maintenance personnel, and team members who need focused access.

As a Standard User, you can:
- View and manage property listings
- Track and update inventory items
- Record and categorize expenses
- Manage your account settings
- Access your assigned shopping lists

Standard Users are focused on day-to-day property operations without administrative responsibilities.

### Standard Admin (Default role)

**Best for**: Property managers, team leaders, and portfolio owners.

As a Standard Admin, you get everything a Standard User can access, plus:
- Dashboard with portfolio analytics
- Owner profiles and management
- Report generation and customization
- Analytics tools for performance tracking
- Team member invitation capabilities
- Portfolio-wide settings management

Standard Admin is the default role assigned when you register a new account.

### Administrator

**Best for**: Organization executives, IT administrators, and platform managers.

As an Administrator, you get everything from the other roles, plus:
- Access to the Admin Panel
- System-wide user management
- Cross-portfolio analytics and reporting
- Activity logs and security monitoring
- System configuration settings
- Global application settings

## Your Account's Role

### Checking Your Current Role

1. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner
2. Select "Account Settings"
3. Your role is displayed under "Account Information"

### Role Limitations

If you find yourself unable to access certain features:

1. The feature may be restricted based on your role
2. You'll see an "Access Denied" message when attempting to visit restricted pages
3. Navigation elements for restricted features won't appear in your sidebar

## Team Management & Permissions

### Inviting Team Members (For Standard Admins)

Standard Admins can invite new users to their portfolio:

1. Navigate to "Settings" → "Team Management"
2. Click "Invite User"
3. Enter the recipient's email address
4. Select "Standard User" as the role
5. Click "Send Invitation"

An email invitation will be sent to join your portfolio.

### User Permissions (For Administrators)

Administrators can modify user permissions:

1. Navigate to "Admin Panel" → "User Management"
2. Find the user in the list
3. Click "Edit"
4. Change the role from the dropdown menu
5. Click "Save"

## Portfolio Access

All users are associated with a specific portfolio, which determines what data you can see:

- You only see listings, owners, and expenses from your portfolio
- Reports and analytics are filtered by your portfolio
- Inventory is specific to your portfolio

Administrators have the ability to view data across all portfolios.

## Restricted Pages & Features

### For Standard Users

The following features are not available to Standard Users:

- Dashboard (redirects to Listings)
- Owner management
- Analytics
- Reports
- Team member invitations
- Admin Panel

### For Standard Admins

The following feature is not available to Standard Admins:

- Admin Panel

## Common Questions

### "I can't access the Dashboard"

If you're a Standard User, you'll be automatically redirected to the Listings page when you try to access the Dashboard. This is by design, as the Dashboard is only available to Standard Admins and Administrators.

### "I need access to additional features"

If you require access to features not available with your current role:

1. Contact your portfolio's Standard Admin for portfolio-specific features
2. Contact an Administrator for system-wide features or role changes

### "How do I change someone's role?"

Only Administrators can change user roles:

1. As an Administrator, go to the Admin Panel
2. Navigate to User Management
3. Edit the user's profile to change their role

## Security Best Practices

### For Standard Admins

- Only invite users who need access to your portfolio
- Regularly review your team members list and remove inactive users
- Use descriptive names when creating new reports to help your team identify their purpose

### For Administrators

- Regularly audit user accounts and roles
- Monitor the activity logs for unusual behavior
- Limit the number of Administrator accounts to only those who absolutely need full system access
