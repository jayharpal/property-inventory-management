# Deployment Guide

This document outlines the deployment process for the Property Management Platform.

## Deployment Options

The application can be deployed in several ways:

1. **Replit Deployment** (Recommended)
2. Self-hosted deployment

## Replit Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Replit account
- PostgreSQL database (provided by Replit)

### Steps

1. **Prepare the Application**
   - Ensure all code is committed to the main branch
   - Run and verify tests: `npm test`
   - Build the frontend: `npm run build`

2. **Deploy via Replit**
   - Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface
   - Select deployment settings:
     - Environment: Production
     - Domain: Choose a custom domain or use the default .replit.app domain
   - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - Verify the application is running correctly
   - Check database connections
   - Test critical functionality

### Updating a Deployment

1. Make changes to your code
2. Test thoroughly
3. Commit changes
4. Click "Deploy" again to update

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret for session encryption | `your-secret-key` |
| `PORT` | Port to run the server on | `3000` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment mode | `production` |

## Database Configuration

The application uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

### Database Migration

Before deployment, ensure the database schema is up to date:

```bash
npm run db:push
```

This uses Drizzle Kit to push the schema to the database.

## Performance Optimization

For production deployments:

1. **Build optimization**
   - Minified JavaScript and CSS
   - Tree-shaking to remove unused code
   - Code splitting for faster initial load

2. **Server optimization**
   - Compression middleware
   - Response caching
   - Rate limiting for API endpoints

3. **Database optimization**
   - Proper indexes on frequently queried fields
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Application health**
   - Server uptime
   - Response times
   - Error rates

2. **Database performance**
   - Query performance
   - Connection pool utilization
   - Storage usage

3. **User metrics**
   - Active users
   - Feature usage
   - Error reports

## Backup and Recovery

Implement regular backups:

1. **Database backups**
   - Scheduled PostgreSQL dumps
   - Store backups in secure location
   - Test restoration process

2. **Application backups**
   - Version control for code
   - Configuration backups
   - Document all custom settings

## Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues:

1. **Database connection failures**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct
   - Check network access to database
   - Confirm database user permissions

2. **Missing environment variables**
   - Check all required variables are set
   - Verify variable format and values

3. **Build failures**
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Verify dependencies are installed
   - Test build locally before deployment

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS**
   - Ensure SSL/TLS is enabled
   - Configure secure headers

2. **Authentication**
   - Secure password storage
   - Session management
   - CSRF protection

3. **Data Protection**
   - Access controls
   - Input validation
   - SQL injection prevention
